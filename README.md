      "description": "I'm Eqan Ahmad, an engineer on a mission to use technology to improve people's lives. I have a wealth of experience in blockchain applications, cloud computing, GenAI(Diffusion Pipelines and Langchain), and full-stack web development with of combined experiences 4+ years. I'm a tech enthusiast, always looking to expand my skillset with the latest tools and technologies. Up until now built a Cloud Computing SaaS for Stable Diffusion to minimize their daily 3rd party reliance cost such as AWS, and runpod.io from 1000$+ per day to less than 500$ per day. But it's not just the tech skills I bring to the table. I was also selected for a prestigious Stanford University fellowship, where I worked with a team to tackle big problems like starvation analysis and sustainable living. I have also been selected for the Prime Minister National Innovation Award to bring industry revolutionary ideas to change the nation's educational paradigm selected from 12,000+ candidates. Also working with Legal Tech Gen AI companies to make tools that allow lawyers to generate and review their drafts seamlessly without spending too much time modifying templates to bring their tone, wording, etc. I'm passionate about user experience and design, and believe that less is more when it comes to features. My personal strengths include a customer-first approach, a strong ethical mindset, and a critical thinking ability that comes in handy for problem-solving. As for my career goals, I'm excited to explore the intersection of technology and automation, and to use my skills to streamline and eliminate repetitive tasks. I'm always up for a new challenge, so bring it on!",
